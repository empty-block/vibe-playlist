# Music Neighbors Algorithm Test Results

**Timestamp**: 2025-07-16 15:48:04
**Algorithm**: Trust-Based Music Discovery
**Test Users**: 3

## Algorithm Overview

The Music Neighbors algorithm uses **trust-based discovery** instead of traditional similarity metrics:

1. **Trust Signal**: Find users whose music posts you've LIKED or REPLIED to
2. **Validation**: Your outgoing interactions indicate taste validation
3. **Discovery**: Surface other music from these trusted users
4. **Scoring**: Trust level × Artist strength in trusted user's library

**Key Advantage**: Recommendations come from people whose taste you've actively validated.

## Algorithm Performance Analysis

- **Users with music data**: 3/3
- **Users with trust relationships**: 3/3

- **Average trust relationships per user**: 5.7

## Comparison with Traditional Similarity

**Traditional Approach** (Jaccard similarity):
- Finds users with overlapping artists
- No social context
- Low similarity scores (typically 0.05-0.15)
- Many single-artist overlaps

**Music Neighbors Approach** (Trust-based):
- Finds users whose taste you've validated through interactions
- Strong social signal (outgoing likes/replies)
- High-confidence recommendations
- Rich discovery potential from trusted users' full libraries

**Recommendation**: The Music Neighbors approach provides more actionable and contextually meaningful music discovery for sparse social music libraries.
