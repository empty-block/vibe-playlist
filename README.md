# 🎵 VIBES 95 - Social Music Through Playlists

VIBES 95 reimagines music sharing by treating **playlists as the fundamental unit** of musical expression. Built on Farcaster's social infrastructure with a nostalgic Windows 95 aesthetic, it turns every music interaction into playlist creation.

## 🎯 The Big Idea: Everything is a Playlist

**Rethinking Music Sharing**: Instead of posting individual tracks to feeds, users create playlist entries. Your profile becomes your personal "Jams" playlist, collaborative playlists become group spaces, and AI algorithms curate discovery playlists.

**Playlists = Farcaster Threads**: Under the hood, every playlist is actually a Farcaster thread:
- When someone creates a playlist, they're starting a new thread
- The first post might contain both the playlist intro AND initial tracks (e.g., "Here are my favorite 90s hits" + songs)
- Each song added is a reply to that thread
- Anyone can contribute by replying with their song suggestions
- The playlist title can be user-provided or AI-generated from thread content

**Three Playlist Types**:
- **👤 Personal**: Your musical identity (e.g., "Alex's Jams") 
- **👥 Collaborative**: Group music curation with friends
- **🤖 AI Curated**: Algorithm-driven discovery based on taste graphs

This unified approach simplifies the mental model - users always think "where should this song go?" rather than complex social media posting concepts.

## 🛠️ For Developers

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/vibes-playlist.git
cd vibes-playlist

# Install dependencies (requires Bun)
bun install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your Spotify Client ID to .env

# Start development server
bun run dev
```

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: SolidJS + TypeScript for reactive UI
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom Win95 components
- **Animations**: anime.js v3.2.1 for smooth UI interactions
- **Audio**: YouTube IFrame API + Spotify Web Playback SDK
- **Backend**: Farcaster protocol for social features
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Component System**: Reusable social components following DRY principles

### Component Architecture
The app follows a **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle** with reusable social components:

- **`SocialStats`**: Consistent likes/recasts/replies display across all contexts
- **`SocialActions`**: Reusable action buttons (like, share, reply) with multiple variants
- **`ReplyItem`**: Standardized reply formatting for desktop and mobile
- **Responsive Player**: Single component that adapts from desktop sidebar to mobile bottom bar
- **Social Modal**: Mobile-optimized overlay for full social experience in compact mode

This architecture ensures:
✅ **Consistency** - Same look/feel everywhere
✅ **Maintainability** - Change once, update everywhere  
✅ **Flexibility** - Components adapt to different contexts
✅ **Mobile-first** - Responsive design with touch-friendly interactions

### Development Notes
⚠️ **Important**: There are specific setup quirks for YouTube/Spotify integration documented in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) - essential reading for developers.

Key issues:
- YouTube embedding requires `localhost` for development
- Spotify auth requires `127.0.0.1` or HTTPS domains
- Solution: Use Cloudflare tunnel for testing both features

## 🎯 Product Vision

VIBES 95 bridges nostalgic design with modern social music concepts:

**Why Playlists?** Traditional social media treats music as disposable content. Playlists create persistent, collaborative spaces where music discoveries accumulate value over time.

**Why Farcaster?** Decentralized social infrastructure means users own their data and relationships, while developers focus on innovative UX rather than building social plumbing.

**Why Retro?** The Windows 95 aesthetic creates a unique, memorable experience that stands out in today's homogeneous design landscape while evoking the era when digital music culture began.

## 🎪 Use Cases

### Music Discovery Communities
- **Genre-focused groups** create collaborative playlists
- **AI algorithms** surface unexpected connections between tracks
- **Social proof** through likes and comments drives discovery

### Personal Music Curation
- **Your profile becomes your playlist** - musical identity on Farcaster
- **Cross-platform music** - YouTube finds, Spotify streams
- **Historical record** of your musical journey over time

### Event and Group Playlists
- **Party planning** - collaborative "Friday Bangers" playlist
- **Study groups** - shared "Focus Music" collections  
- **Road trips** - group-curated "Drive Music" playlists
