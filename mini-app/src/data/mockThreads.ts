This track defined an entire generation and somehow it still sounds as urgent and relevant today as it did in 1991. The dirty guitar tone, the explosive drums - it\'s all just perfect chaos. Still my favorite song to blast in the car when I need to let it all out.'

The fast-paced punk energy combined with that insanely catchy melody - it\'s no wonder this track became an anthem. Still gets me pumped every time I hear those opening power chords.'

Thom Yorke\'s falsetto in the chorus hits so hard emotionally. That explosive guitar breakdown by Jonny Greenwood is pure catharsis. This song spoke to every outsider in the 90s and it still resonates today.'

Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel gave voice to the struggles of inner-city life in a way that was both brutally honest and incredibly powerful. The Message showed that rap could be more than just party music - it could tell real stories and shine a light on social issues. An absolute foundational track for the entire genre.'
