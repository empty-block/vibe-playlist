# 🎵 Jamzy - Social Music Through Playlists

Jamzy reimagines music sharing by treating **playlists as the fundamental unit** of musical expression. Built on Farcaster's social infrastructure with a nostalgic Windows 95 aesthetic, it turns every music interaction into playlist creation.

## 🎯 The Big Idea: Everything is a Playlist

**Rethinking Music Sharing**: Instead of posting individual tracks to feeds, users create playlist entries. Your profile becomes your personal "Jams" playlist, collaborative playlists become group spaces, and AI algorithms curate discovery playlists.

**Playlists = Farcaster Threads**: Under the hood, every playlist is actually a Farcaster thread:
- When someone creates a playlist, they're starting a new thread
- The first post might contain both the playlist intro AND initial tracks (e.g., "Here are my favorite 90s hits" + songs)
- Each song added is a reply to that thread
- Anyone can contribute by replying with their song suggestions
- The playlist title can be user-provided or AI-generated from thread content

**Three Playlist Types**:
- **👤 Personal**: Your musical identity (e.g., "Alex's Jams") 
- **👥 Collaborative**: Group music curation with friends
- **🤖 AI Curated**: Algorithm-driven discovery based on taste graphs

This unified approach simplifies the mental model - users always think "where should this song go?" rather than complex social media posting concepts.

## 🤖 AI-as-Assistant Philosophy

Jamzy's AI features are designed to **enhance human creativity, not replace it**. Our approach positions AI as a supportive assistant that helps users express their musical vision more naturally and efficiently.

### Core Principles
- **Human-Driven Curation**: Users maintain creative control over their playlists
- **AI Suggests, Users Decide**: The AI provides options and explanations; users make the final choices
- **Natural Language Interface**: Conversational UI eliminates manual searching and data entry
- **Creative Enhancement**: AI helps users discover and organize music they wouldn't find otherwise
- **Transparent Reasoning**: AI suggestions include explanations for why tracks were recommended

### Implementation Examples
- **Playlist Discovery**: Instead of complex search forms, users chat naturally ("I want some Frank Ocean vibes for late night coding")
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI recommends tracks with reasoning ("This song has that same ethereal quality you love")
- **Assisted Organization**: AI helps categorize and title playlists based on user preferences
- **Discovery Enhancement**: AI finds similar artists and tracks to expand user's musical horizons

This philosophy ensures that technology serves creativity rather than constraining it, making music discovery feel like collaboration with a knowledgeable friend rather than interaction with a search algorithm.

```

### Quick Start - Frontend
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/vibes-playlist.git
cd vibes-playlist

# Install TypeScript dependencies (requires Bun)
bun install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your Spotify Client ID to .env

# Start development server
bun run dev
```

### Quick Start - Python Data Processing
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables for Python services
export SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-service-key"
export DUNE_API_KEY="your-dune-api-key"

# Run data pipelines
cd data/pipelines
python -m flow
```

### Technical Architecture
**Frontend Stack:**
- **Frontend**: SolidJS + TypeScript for reactive UI
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom Win95 components
- **Animations**: anime.js v3.2.1 for smooth UI interactions
- **Audio**: YouTube IFrame API + Spotify Web Playback SDK
- **Backend**: Farcaster protocol for social features
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages

**Data Processing Stack:**
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Data Source**: Dune Analytics for Farcaster data
- **Pipeline Framework**: Prefect for workflow orchestration
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, Polars for data manipulation
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude for music metadata extraction


### Development Notes
⚠️ **Important**: There are specific setup quirks for YouTube/Spotify integration documented in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) - essential reading for developers.

Key issues:
- YouTube embedding requires `localhost` for development
- Spotify auth requires `127.0.0.1` or HTTPS domains
- Solution: Use Cloudflare tunnel for testing both features
