- Showcase AI-as-assistant philosophy (not replacement)
- Demonstrate collaborative playlist creation
- Highlight multi-source integration (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud)
- Appeal to Farcaster/crypto-native audience
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Fast loading with engaging interactions

### Success Criteria
- Clear understanding of "Everything is a Playlist" concept
- Demonstrates AI assistant value without intimidation
- Showcases social/collaborative features effectively
- Drives signups and first playlist creation
- Reflects platform's innovative, friendly personality
- High engagement metrics (time on page, scroll depth)
