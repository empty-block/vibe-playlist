# Thread Starter Track Display - Design Plan
**Date:** September 12, 2025 15:30  
**Task:** Display the original track that started a thread above the reply tracks

## 🎯 Core Requirement

**Simple Goal:** When viewing a thread, show the original track that started the conversation above the current library table (which shows all the reply tracks).

**Key Insight:** This is just a display enhancement - no new functionality needed. Every track can already start threads (ADD TRACK) and receive replies (ADD TRACK as replies). We just need to show the original track prominently.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Following Jamzy's retro-cyberpunk aesthetic, the thread starter should feel like a "master record" or "primary entry" in the music database - something that stands out from the reply tracks below with appropriate visual hierarchy.

**Visual Metaphor:** Think early music software where the main track/album had special display treatment, while related tracks were listed below in a table format.

## 📐 Layout Integration Strategy

### Selected Approach: **Replace Browse Sections**
The cleanest integration is to replace the existing Browse Sections (Artist/Genre filtering) area with the thread starter display when in thread mode.

**Why This Works:**
- Uses existing real estate efficiently
- Natural visual flow: Thread starter → Filters → Reply tracks
- Maintains familiar layout structure
- Browse sections are less critical when viewing a specific thread

### Layout Flow (Thread Mode)
```
[Header with mobile toggle + title + profile]
[Search and Filters]
[THREAD STARTER TRACK] ← Replaces Browse Sections
[Track Table - Reply Tracks]
[Pagination]
```

### Layout Flow (Normal Library Mode)
```
[Header with mobile toggle + title + profile]
[Search and Filters]
[Browse Sections - Artist/Genre] ← Normal flow
[Track Table - All Tracks]
[Pagination]
```

## 🎛️ Thread Starter Component Design

### Visual Treatment
The thread starter track gets a distinctive "hero track" treatment that differentiates it from table rows:

**Container Styling:**
- **Background:** Subtle neon-blue glow (`--darker-bg` with neon-blue border)
- **Border:** 2px solid `--neon-blue` with subtle glow effect
- **Spacing:** `--space-6` (24px) padding, `--space-4` (16px) margins
- **Corner Treatment:** Sharp corners (consistent with retro aesthetic)

**Layout Structure:**
```html
<div class="thread-starter-container">
  <div class="thread-starter-header">
    <span class="thread-starter-label">ORIGINAL TRACK</span>
    <span class="thread-starter-meta">{reply_count} replies</span>
  </div>
  <div class="thread-starter-track">
    <!-- Enhanced track display -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Track Display Enhancement

**Track Card Structure:**
- **Album Art:** 80x80px (larger than table rows' 48px)
- **Typography:** Larger text hierarchy than table rows
  - Title: `--text-xl` (24px) in `--light-text`
  - Artist: `--text-lg` (20px) in `--neon-cyan` 
  - Album/Duration: `--text-base` (16px) in `--muted-text`
- **Actions:** Play button with enhanced glow, Add to Library button
- **Platform Badge:** Spotify/YouTube indicator with neon accent

**Distinctive Elements:**
- **Pulse Animation:** Subtle neon-blue pulse every 3 seconds to indicate "active thread"
- **Reply Count Badge:** Shows number of replies with neon-pink accent
- **Thread Icon:** Musical note with conversation bubble overlay
- **Enhanced Hover:** Stronger glow effect than regular track rows

## 🖥️ Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (768px+)
- Full hero track layout as described above
- Horizontal layout with album art left, details center, actions right
- Maximum width matches table width for alignment

### Tablet (640-767px)
- Slightly reduced album art (64x64px)
- Maintained horizontal layout with adjusted spacing
- Reply count moves below title for better flow

### Mobile (320-639px)
- Album art: 56x56px (matches mobile card size)
- Vertical layout: Art top, details below, actions at bottom
- Simplified typography scale (one step smaller)
- Tap-friendly actions (44px minimum touch targets)

## ⚡ Animation & Interaction

### Entry Animation
```typescript
// Thread starter enters with slide-down + fade-in
const threadStarterEnter = {
  opacity: [0, 1],
  translateY: [-20, 0],
  duration: 300,
  easing: 'easeOutQuad'
}
```

### Hover State
```css
.thread-starter-track:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(59, 0, 253, 0.4); /* Enhanced neon-blue glow */
  transform: translateY(-2px); /* Stronger lift than table rows */
  transition: all 200ms ease;
}
```

### Active Thread Pulse
```css
@keyframes thread-pulse {
  0%, 100% { 
    box-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(59, 0, 253, 0.3); 
  }
  50% { 
    box-shadow: 0 0 16px rgba(59, 0, 253, 0.5); 
  }
}

.thread-starter-container {
  animation: thread-pulse 3s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

## 🔧 Implementation Architecture

### Component Structure
```
components/
├── library/
│   ├── ThreadStarter/
│   │   ├── ThreadStarterContainer.tsx    # Main container component
│   │   ├── ThreadStarterTrack.tsx        # Enhanced track display
│   │   ├── ThreadStarterHeader.tsx       # Header with label + meta
│   │   └── thread-starter.css           # Specific styling
│   └── LibraryMainContent.tsx           # Modified to conditionally show
```

### Integration Points

**LibraryMainContent.tsx Modifications:**
1. Add thread mode prop: `threadId?: string`
2. Add thread starter data prop: `threadStarterTrack?: Track`
3. Conditional rendering logic:
   ```tsx
   {/* Thread Starter - Replaces Browse Sections in thread mode */}
   <Show 
     when={props.threadId && props.threadStarterTrack}
     fallback={
       <Show when={props.browseFilters && props.onBrowseFiltersChange}>
         <BrowseSectionsContainer ... />
       </Show>
     }
   >
     <ThreadStarterContainer 
       track={props.threadStarterTrack!}
       threadId={props.threadId!}
       replyCount={getCurrentFiltered().length}
     />
   </Show>
   ```

**LibraryLayout.tsx Modifications:**
- Pass through thread mode props from parent
- Maintain existing filter state management (still needed for reply filtering)

**LibraryPage.tsx Modifications:**
- Detect thread mode from URL params or props
- Load thread starter track data alongside reply tracks
- Pass thread data to LibraryLayout

### Data Flow
```
ThreadPage/LibraryPage (thread mode)
  ↓ (threadId, threadStarterTrack)
LibraryLayout
  ↓ (threadId, threadStarterTrack)
LibraryMainContent
  ↓ (conditional render)
ThreadStarterContainer
  ↓ (track, threadId, replyCount)
ThreadStarterTrack
```

## 🎵 Track Data Requirements

The thread starter track should include:
```typescript
interface ThreadStarterTrack extends Track {
  // Standard track properties
  id: string;
  title: string;
  artist: string;
  album?: string;
  duration: number;
  thumbnail: string;
  platform: 'spotify' | 'youtube';
  
  // Thread-specific metadata
  threadId: string;
  createdAt: string;
  createdBy: User;
  replyCount: number;
  isOriginalPost: true; // Flag for styling/behavior
}
```

## 📱 State Management

### Loading States
```css
.thread-starter-loading {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, 
    rgba(59, 0, 253, 0.1), 
    rgba(59, 0, 253, 0.3), 
    rgba(59, 0, 253, 0.1)
  );
  background-size: 200% 100%;
  animation: loading-shimmer 1.5s infinite;
}
```

### Error State
- Graceful fallback to Browse Sections if thread starter fails to load
- Error message with retry option: "Unable to load original track. [Retry]"
- Maintains thread reply functionality even if starter fails

### Empty State
- Should not occur in normal flow (every thread has a starter by definition)
- Fallback: Show Browse Sections if somehow no thread starter exists

## ✨ Enhanced Features

### Context Actions
- **View Thread Creator:** Click artist/user to see profile
- **Share Thread:** Share the entire thread conversation
- **Add to Personal Library:** Add the starter track specifically
- **View Thread History:** See thread evolution over time (future feature)

### Visual Indicators
- **Hot Thread Badge:** For threads with >20 replies in last 24h
- **Original Curator Badge:** Special highlighting for track discoverer
- **Platform Integration:** Rich previews for Spotify/YouTube links

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Lazy Loading:** Thread starter loads after initial page render
2. **Image Preloading:** Preload album art for smooth display
3. **Animation Performance:** Use `transform` and `opacity` only
4. **Memory Management:** Clean up animations on component unmount

### Caching Strategy
- Cache thread starter data locally for 5 minutes
- Invalidate cache when new replies are added
- Progressive loading: Show basic info first, enhance with metadata

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### User Experience Goals
- **Immediate Clarity:** User understands thread structure within 2 seconds
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between starter and replies
- **Engagement:** Increased interaction with original tracks
- **Navigation:** Smooth flow between thread view and library view

### Technical Goals
- **Performance:** <100ms additional load time for thread starter
- **Responsive:** Flawless display across all device sizes
- **Accessibility:** Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Animations:** 60fps smooth animations with fallbacks

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- **Thread Branching:** Visual indicators for sub-conversations
- **Time-based View:** See thread evolution chronologically
- **Collaborative Playlists:** Turn threads into shared playlists
- **AI Thread Summaries:** Generate conversation highlights

### Integration Opportunities
- **Social Features:** Like/share specific thread starters
- **Discovery Engine:** Recommend similar thread starters
- **Creator Tools:** Enhanced analytics for thread creators
- **Community Features:** Thread starter "halls of fame"
