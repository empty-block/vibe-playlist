## Project Structure
```
vibes-playlist/
â”œâ”€â”€ vibes-themes.html    # The entire app (HTML + JS + CSS)
â”œâ”€â”€ super-simple-server.ts # Simple Bun server (7 lines!)
â””â”€â”€ package.json         # Scripts and dependencies
```

## Why Vanilla JS?
- **Zero build time** - Just save and refresh
- **Instant load** - No framework overhead
- **Simple deployment** - It's one HTML file
- **Easy to understand** - No abstractions

## Customization
- Edit `vibes-themes.html` directly
- All themes are defined in the `themes` object
- Add new playlists in the `playlists` object
- Modify column widths by dragging the resize handles

## Old React/SolidJS Setup
The project originally included React/SolidJS setups. They're still here if needed:
- `bun run dev:old` - Runs the old SolidJS setup
- See `server.tsx`, `src/` for the component-based version
